Being healthy should not be considered a privilege; rather, it should be the norm. At the Ishya Foundation, we understand the importance of health and well-being fully. Sometimes the lack of health and well-being stems from a lack of resources, and sometimes it is because of ignorance mixed with age-old superstitions. And we work on both aspects—we regularly organise health camps and also conduct awareness programs on various health and wellness issues. Along with, we also pitch in with services that help in enhancing lifestyles. We are driven by the aim of making health and wellness accessible to all and creating a society that’s strong from within. On the following pages, you’ll ﬁnd some of the projects we have executed to this effect. We have been organising health camps regularly on a quarterly and half-yearly basis where we reach out to people with limited access to resources. One such camp was organised at the Ishya Learning Centre with the support of Yatharth Hospital. The camp provided comprehensive health assessments directly to the community, with a special focus on promoting preventive healthcare.",
