          Ishya Foundation and our affiliates (“Ishya,” “we,” “us,” “our”) know
          how important is it to maintain the privacy of our users, and we
          therefore are very cautious about how we collect, use, disclose,
          transfer and store your information. This Privacy Policy applies to
          the Services, however any additional consent will be obtained for
          certain data processing activities. Please note that the Privacy
          Policy applies to your usage of our Services. It also applies

          other device to access our Services. It is important that you read
          the Privacy Policy carefully because anytime you use our Services,

          information about you from third-party social networking services
          when you choose to connect with those services. If you order a

          can make choices about whether to receive promotional communications
          from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the

        </p>

        <h2>Accessing Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          You may have the right to request details about the information we

          statutory user rights remain unaffected. If permitted by law, we may
          charge you a small fee for providing you with this ability. We may
          decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require
          disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others,
          are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise
          required by local law. If you would like to make a request to access
          your information, please contact our customer service department at

          outside our control. We are not responsible for the security or
          privacy of any information collected by websites or other services.
          You should exercise caution, and review the privacy statements
          applicable to the third-party websites and services you use. We also

          available through app stores) developed by third parties. Ishya
          Foundation is not responsible in any manner whatsoever for these

        </p>

        <h2>
          Third Parties that Provide Content, Advertising or Functionality on
          Our Services
        </h2>
        <p>
          Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services
          may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. For
          example:
          <br />
          a. Certain third parties may serve advertising or keep track of which
          advertisements users see, how often they see those advertisements,
          and what users do in response to them;
          <br />
          b. We enable you to share certain materials on the Services with
          others through social networking services such as Facebook, Twitter,
          Google +, and LinkedIn.
          <br />
          c. These third-parties may collect or receive certain information
          about your use of the Services, including through the use of cookies,
          beacons, and similar technologies, and this information may be
          collected over time and combined with information collected across
          different websites and online services. Some of these companies
          participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide
          consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising. If
          you connect with a social networking service, we may receive and
          store authentication information from that service to enable you to
          log in, as well as other information that you allow us to receive
          when you connect with these services. Also, please note that if you
          choose to connect with a social networking service on a device used
          by people in addition to you, those other users may be able to see
          information stored or displayed in connection with your account on
          the social networking service(s) with which you connect.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies, Beacons and Similar Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We, as well as certain third parties that provide content,
          advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies,
          beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our Services.
        </p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV,
          mobile phone or other device. They enable the entity that put the
          cookie on your device to recognise you across different websites,
          services, devices, and/or browsing sessions. Cookies serve many
          useful purposes. For example:
          <br />
          a. Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to
          enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.
          <br />
          b. Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our
          Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages
          and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are
          spending on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are
          better able to adapt the Services and provide you with a better
          experience.
          <br />
          c. Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have
          seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a
          Service.
          <br />
          d. Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant
          content and advertising by collecting information about your use of
          our Services and other websites and apps. When you use a web browser
          to access the Services, you can configure your browser to accept all
          cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent.
          Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser
          to learn how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system
          of your device may contain additional controls for cookies. Please
          note, however, that some Services may be designed to work using
          cookies and that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use
          those Services, or certain parts of them.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Local Storage</h3>
        <p>
          We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local
          storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to
          as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our
          Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed
          above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to
          store certain information about your activities and preferences.
          However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your
          device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control
          them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about
          disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please
          click here.
        </p>

        <h3>Beacons</h3>
        <p>
          We, along with certain third parties, also may use technologies
          called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your
          device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content,
          videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of
          information from your device, know when you have viewed particular
          content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on
          which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We
          and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes,
          including to analyse the use of our Services and (in conjunction
          with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to
          you. By accessing and using our Services, you consent to the storage
          of cookies, other local storage technologies, beacons and other
          information on your devices. You also consent to the access of such
          cookies, local storage technologies, beacons and information by us
          and by the third parties mentioned above.
        </p>
